### 🙋🏽‍♂️About Me

I'm a **machine learning engineer** from Finland.

I have always been kind of a tech geek, but it wasn't until 2017 that I found my passion for developing apps & websites. Ever since then I have been building & breaking stuff with code almost daily.

Somewhere along the journey I started reading more and more about data and what you can do with it. It did not take long for me to develop an interest in data science and machine learning. It never stops to amaze me how much we can teach our computers to do.

I love to explore, build & fix things. That is what drives me. The best part of my day is when I get a cup of coffee, sit down to my desk and start working on a project.

When I'm not working I like to go for long walks, photograph, read books or play some games. I'm a lifelong learner, always curious and always learning something. That is one of the main reasons I love to work in this field. Since I started coding, there has not been a single day that I did not learn something new.
